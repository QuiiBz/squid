Yarn is highly recommended, but you can still use NPM.

First, make sure you have NPM or Yarn installed on your system. Then:
1) Fork this repository, then clone it to your device
2) Install JS dependencies with:
    - NPM: `npm install`
    - Yarn: `yarn`
3) Launch the development server and the app:
    - NPM: `npm run dev`
    - Yarn: `yarn dev`

To make a executable file, run:
- NPM: `npm run dist`
- Yarn: `yarn dist`

Don't forget to run **linting** after any code changes with the `lint` script:
- NPM: `npm run lint`
- YARN:  `yarn lint`
