Yarn is highly recommanded, but you can still use NPM.

First of all, make sure you have NPM or Yarn installed on your system. Then:
1) Fork this repository, then clone it to your device
2) Install JS dependencies with:
   - NPM: `npm install`
   - Yarn: `yarn`
3) Launch the development server and the app:
   - NPM: `npm run electron:serve`
   - Yarn: `yarn electron:serve`

To make a executable file, run:
  - NPM: `npm run electron:build`
  - Yarn: `yarn electron:build`
  
Don't forget to run **linting** with the `lint` script.
