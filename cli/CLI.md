## Developing the CLI
First, make sure you have Yarn installed on your system.

Then:
1) Install JS dependencies with:
- `yarn`
2) Start the compilation:
- `yarn watch`
3) Run the CLI to test it:
- `yarn start`

You can add any arguments and options: `yarn start --version`.

### Building
To build the CLI, run `yarn dist`. The compiled file is located at `resources/cli/cli.js`
